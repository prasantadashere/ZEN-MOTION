# ZEN-MOTION
This repo is for GSC 2024 Project.



Project Setup:
The global challenge we are addressing in the Google Solution Challenge revolves around providing a comprehensive solution to all mental health problems. Our chosen problem statement aligns with Sustainable Development Goal number 3, focusing on health and well-being. The aim is to create a platform that promotes mental health awareness and offers practical tools for individuals to improve their well-being.

Our project, named "Zen Motion," is undertaken by the team TechSpritz. We have identified key features to be incorporated into our solution, including a chat room for discussions, a resource section for reading materials, links to relevant videos, and an activity room suggesting mental health-enhancing games such as Sudoku.The core features, including the chat room, resource section, and activity room, are being developed with great care. The team is also working on implementing the liking mechanism for helpful chats, as well as the user profile feature that showcases the number of people one has positively impacted. These features are designed to provide a holistic approach to mental health support.

To visualize our concept and user interface, we have created prototypes for both a web app and a mobile app using Figma. These prototypes serve as a foundation for the development phase.

Implementation:
Currently, our team is actively working on translating the Figma prototypes into functional code. The development process is ongoing, and we are focusing on creating a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates the identified features. Our codebase is being structured to ensure scalability and maintainability as we move forward.

Feedback/Testing/Iteration:
Once the initial development is complete, we plan to conduct thorough testing to ensure the functionality and usability of our platform. User feedback will be crucial in refining the user experience and addressing any potential issues. The iterative process will involve making adjustments based on feedback and further optimizing the platform for a seamless user experience.

Success and Completion of Solution:
Success will be measured by the impact our platform has on users' mental well-being. Metrics such as user engagement, positive feedback, and the number of individuals benefiting from the resources and support provided will be key indicators of success. Completion of the solution will involve ensuring that all planned features are implemented and thoroughly tested.

Scalability/Next Steps:
Looking ahead, scalability is a critical consideration. We plan to assess the platform's performance and scalability to accommodate a growing user base. Future steps include refining and expanding the platform based on user feedback, incorporating additional features, and potentially collaborating with mental health professionals to enhance the effectiveness of our solution. Scalability will be a key focus to ensure Zen Motion can reach and support as many individuals as possible in their mental health journey.
